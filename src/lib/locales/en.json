  "asom-net resume": "A part-time job I have maintained throughout my high school and Datamatiker studies. The work has involved assisting customers with their email setup, television, and internet signal. This has provided me with the opportunity to learn a lot about how ordinary users utilize IT and how their IT knowledge gives them a different starting point when solving tasks. This is also where my interest in servers and networks began.",
